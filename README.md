# Integration

Many-core integration algorithm, with classes to use them in C++.

# Installation

Set the `INSTALL_ROOT` environment variable to the location of the pipeline sourcode.
If this package is installed in `$HOME/Code/APERTIF/Dedispersion` this would be:

```bash
 $ export INSTALL_ROOT=$HOME/Code/APERTIF
```

Then build and test as follows:

```bash
 $ make install
```

## Dependencies

* [utils](https://github.com/isazi/utils) - master branch
* [OpenCL](https://github.com/isazi/OpenCL) - master branch
* [AstroData](https://github.com/isazi/AstroData) - master branch

# Included programs

The integration step is typically compiled as part of a larger pipeline, but this repo contains two example programs in the `bin/` directory to test and autotune an integration kernel.

## IntegrationTest

Checks if the output of the CPU is the same for the GPU.
The CPU is assumed to be always correct.
Takes platform, layout, and kernel arguments, and has the following extra parameters:

 * *print_code*     Print kernel source code
 * *print_results*  Prints the integrated data
 * *random*         Use random data instead of the default test data

## IntegrationTuning

Tune the integration kernel's parameters by doing a complete sampling of the parameter space.
Kernel configuration and runtime statistics are written to stdout.
Takes platform, layout, and tuning arguments.

The output can be analyzed using the python scripts in in the *analysis* directory.

## printCode

Prints the code for a specific integration kernel to stdout.
Takes platform, layout, and kernel arguments.

## Commandline arguments

Description of common commandline arguments for the separate binaries.

### Compute platform specific arguments

 * *opencl_platform*     OpenCL platform
 * *opencl_device*       OpenCL device number
 * *padding*             number of elements in the cacheline of the platform
 * *vector*              vector size in number of elements

### Data layout arguments

 * *samples*       Number of samples; ie length of time dimension
 * *dms*           Number of dispersion measures; ie length second dimension
 * *integration*   Number of individual samples to add
 * *dms_samples*   Ordering of the two dimensions: samples is fastest
 * *samples_dms*   Ordering of the two dimensions: dms is fastest

### Tuning parameters

 * *iterations*    Number of times to run a specific kernel to improve statistics.
 * *min_threads*   Minimum number of threads
 * *max_threads*   Maximum number of threads
 * *max_items*     Maximum number of variables that the automated code is allowed to use.

### Kernel Configuration arguments

 * *samples_per_block*       Number of samples per block
 * *samples_per_thread*      Number of samples per thread

# Analyzing tuning output

Kernel statistics can be saved to a database, and analyzed to find the optimal configuration.

## Setup

### MariaDB

Install mariadb, fi. via your package manager. Then:

0. log in to the database: ` $ mysql`
1. create a database to hold our tuning data: `create database AAALERT`
2. make sure we can use it (replace USER with your username): `grant all privileges on AAALERT.* to 'USER'@'localhost';` 
3. copy the template configuration file: `cp analysis/config.py.orig analysis/config.py` and enter your configuration.

### Python

The analysis scripts use some python3 packages. An easy way to set this up is using `virtualenv`:

```bash
$ cd $INSTALL_ROOT/Integration/analysis`
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages --python=python3 env`
$ . env/bin/activate`
```

And then install the missing packages:

```bash
$ pip install pymysql
```

## Run Analysis

The analysis is controlled by the `analysis/dedispersin.py` script.
It prints data as space-separated data to stdout, where you can plot it with fi. gnuplot, or copy-paste it in your favorite spreadsheet.
You can also write it to a file, that can then be read by the integration code.

1. List current tables: `./integration.py list`
2. Create a table: `./integration.py create <table name>`
3. Enter a file create with DedispersionTuning into the database: `./integration load <table name> <file name>`
4. Find optimal kernel configuration: `./integration.py tune <table name> max <channels> <samples>`
     
The tune subcommand also takes a number of different parameters: `./integration.py tune <table> <operator> <channels> <samples> [local|cache] [split|cont]`

 * operator: max, min, avg, std  (SQL aggergation commands)
 * channels: number of channels
 * samples: number of samples
 * local|cache  When specified, only consider local or cache kernels. See tuning document.
 * split|cont   When specified, only consider with or without the split_second option. See tuning document.

# Included classes

## configuration.hpp

The code is based on templates, for running the test pipeline we need to define some actual types.
This file contains the datatypes used by this package.

## Integration.hpp

 * integrationConf class
 * readTunedIntegrationConf
 * integrationDMsSamples
 * integrationSamplesDMs
 * getIntegrationDMsSamplesOpenCL
 * getIntegrationSamplesDMsOpenCL
